# Accessibility Presentation

## This document will guide you on how to create the presentation for accessibility workshop that I will do.
## You will have to write the presentation to index.html file.

I am writing this presentation using reveal.js (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) so if you need guidance on how to do this, you can use this as a guide for yourself.

The presentation will be presented into three parts, between each part there will be a 10 minute break. So you need to include this in-between the parts as well.

And here's the list of the topics I want to discuss

- **Part 1: Foundations of Accessibility in Flutter (30-45 minutes)**

- (Just mention briefly) Key principles (WCAG basics, POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)

- Overview of Flutterâ€™s accessibility features: fetch this at https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/accessibility if you need more information

- Semantics widget (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flutter/semantics-flutter/) and please also include the examples as well

- Focus and keyboard navigation (https://appt.org/en/docs/flutter/samples/accessibility-focus), also include samples

- Screen reader support (TalkBack, VoiceOver) -> https://blog.gskinner.com/archives/2022/09/flutter-crafting-a-great-experience-for-screen-readers.html

- Accessible gestures -> https://appt.org/en/docs/flutter/samples

- **Part 2: Interactive Case Study - Part I (60 minutes)**

Lets use this for placeholder for now, I will create another prompt later

- **Part 3: Scaling Accessibility in Large Codebases (60 minutes)**

Lets use this for placeholder for now, I will create another prompt later

- **Last Part, Q&A and closing**
